# Hex-compiler-for-Linux
This is a script generated with the help of ChatGPT to compile .hex files on Linux without having to use the terminal.

You only need to download the .sh file and make it executable.
The script provides step-by-step instructions to compile the .hex file, but this is a development version, and the only available language is Spanish.
